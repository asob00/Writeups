# SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass

## What do we know?
- site is vulnerable to SQL Injection attack
- logging functionality is implemented in insecure way

## What do we have to do?
- bypass login authentication

## Solution:
From lab title and description I read that it's simple challenge. 

My first thought was, that SQL Query looks probably like:

`FROM users SELECT * WHERE username='...' AND password='...'`

It's really simple challenge, all I had to do was add some logic in input field, that is always true after OR statement, so malicious query will look something like that:

`FROM users SELECT * WHERE username='' OR 1=1--' AND password='...'`

As we can see either one of statements: username='' or 1=1 must be true and 1=1 is always true. And the rest after 1=1 is commented out by dashes.
## Final payload looks like this:
Username: `' OR 1=1--`

Password: `a`
