# SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

## What do we know?
- site is vulnerable to SQL Injection attack
- searching products functionality is vulnerable
- SQL Query is:
`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 `

## What do we have to do?
- show hidden products

## Solution:
Lab description gives us information how query to database looks like.

This challenge is similar to SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass, because I want to break out of category parameter and insert logical True. After going into website and changing products category, I saw that information about category is passed in URL. I can put my part of query to bypass filter checking if product is released. Similarly to SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass instead of passing normal string to "category" parameter I send: `' OR 1=1--`. Special characters will get URL encoded automatically.
## Final payload looks like this:
URL:

 `https://"lab-id".web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' OR 1=1--`
